# handsign-recognition-usingASL
The hand sign recognition system for deaf people using Python is a technology that enables communication between the hearing impaired and non-hearing impaired individuals.
Python is an ideal programming language for developing this system because of its simplicity, flexibility, and ability to handle complex algorithms.
With the use of Python libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras, developers can easily create a robust and accurate hand sign recognition system.

#The Importance of Hand Sign Recognition System for Deaf People
For deaf people, communication can be a significant challenge, especially when interacting with non-deaf individuals. 
The inability to hear and speak creates a communication barrier that can lead to social isolation and limited access to information.
The hand sign recognition system for deaf people using Python provides a solution to this problem by enabling deaf individuals to communicate with non-deaf individuals through hand gestures.
This technology bridges the communication gap and enhances social interaction, education, and employment opportunities for deaf people.


#How the Hand Sign Recognition System Works
The hand sign recognition system for deaf people using Python works by capturing images of hand gestures using a camera. 
These images are then processed by machine learning algorithms that identify and classify the hand gestures based on their features.Once the hand gesture is recognized, the system converts it into text.  


#Challenges of Implementing Hand Sign Recognition System
Despite the many advantages of using Python for developing the hand sign recognition system, there are still some challenges . 
One of the significant challenges is the variability of hand gestures among different individuals.
Hand gestures vary in shape, size, and speed, making it challenging to develop a system that can accurately recognize all hand gestures. 
Additionally, environmental factors such as lighting and background can affect the accuracy of the system. We must have to  address these challenges to create a robust and accurate hand sign recognition system.

#SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
The prerequisites software libraries for the sign language project are: 
1. Python 
2. IDE (PyCharm) 
3.NumPy 
4.OpenCV -  OpenCV is used to track the gestures from the input stream and then it is fed to the  Media Pipe interface.
5.TensorFlow (as keras uses TensorFlow in backend and for image preprocessing) 
6.Media Pipe -  It extracts the feature points tracked by OpenCV
7.CVzone - A Computer vision package that makes  easy to run Image processing and AI functions.
8.Google Teachable Machine - Â Train a computer to recognize your images, sounds, & poses, then export your model for your sites, apps, and more.
